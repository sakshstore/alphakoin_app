<p class="card-text">

<p class="card-text">

<p class="card-text">
4.1 Independent Controllers. Subject to Section 4.3 (End Controllers), each party:<br>

(a) is an independent controller of Controller Personal Data under the Data Protection Legislation;<br>

(b) will individually determine the purposes and means of its processing of Controller Personal Data; and<br>

(c) will comply with the obligations applicable to it under the Data Protection Legislation regarding the processing of Controller Personal Data.<br></p>

4.3 End Controllers. Without reducing either party’s obligations under these Controller Terms, each party acknowledges that:<br> (a) the other party’s Affiliates or clients may be End Controllers; and (b) the other party may act as a processor on behalf of its End Controllers. The DubaiKoin End Controllers are: (i) for European Controller Personal Data processed by DubaiKoin, DubaiKoin Ireland Limited; and (ii) for UK Controller Personal Data processed by DubaiKoin, DubaiKoin LLC. Each party will ensure that its End Controllers comply with the Controller Terms, including (where applicable) the Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>


<p class="card-text">
<b>5. Data Transfers</b>
Either party may transfer Controller Personal Data to third countries if it complies with the provisions on the transfer of personal data to third countries in the European Data Protection Legislation.</p>


<p class="card-text">
<b>6. Standard Contractual Clauses</b><br></p>

<p class="card-text">
6.1 Transfers of European Controller Personal Data to Customer. To the extent that:<br>

(a) DubaiKoin transfers European Controller Personal Data to Customer; and<br>

(b) Customer is established in a third country that is not subject to an adequacy decision under the European Data Protection Legislation,

Customer as data importer will be deemed to have entered into the Standard Contractual Clauses with DubaiKoin Ireland Limited (the applicable DubaiKoin End Controller) as data exporter and the transfers will be subject to the Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>


<p class="card-text">

6.2 Transfers of UK Controller Personal Data to Customer. To the extent that:<br>

(a) DubaiKoin transfers UK Controller Personal Data to Customer; and<br>

(b) Customer is established in a third country that is not subject to an adequacy decision under the UK GDPR,

Customer as data importer will be deemed to have entered into the Standard Contractual Clauses with DubaiKoin LLC (the applicable DubaiKoin End Controller) as data exporter and the transfers will be subject to the Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>


<p class="card-text">
6.3 Transfers of European Controller Personal Data to DubaiKoin. The parties acknowledge that to the extent Customer transfers European Controller Personal Data to DubaiKoin, the Standard Contractual Clauses are not required because DubaiKoin Ireland Limited (the applicable DubaiKoin End Controller) is established in Ireland and such transfers are therefore permitted under the European Data Protection Legislation. This does not affect Imilescoin’s obligations under Section 5 (Data Transfers).</p>


<p class="card-text">
6.4 Transfers of UK Controller Personal Data to DubaiKoin. To the extent that Customer transfers UK Controller Personal Data to DubaiKoin, Customer as data exporter will be deemed to have entered into the Standard Contractual Clauses with DubaiKoin LLC (the applicable DubaiKoin End Controller) as data importer and the transfers will be subject to the Standard Contractual Clauses, because DubaiKoin LLC is established in the USA and such transfers are therefore to a third country that is not subject to an adequacy decision under the UK GDPR.</p>


<p class="card-text">
6.5 Additional Commercial Clauses for the Standard Contractual Clauses. Sections </p>
<p class="card-text">6.6 (Contacting DubaiKoin) to 6.9 (Third-Party Controllers) are additional commercial clauses relating to the Standard Contractual Clauses as permitted by Clause VII (Variation of these clauses) of the Standard Contractual Clauses. Nothing in Sections 6.6 (Contacting DubaiKoin) to 6.9 (Third-Party Controllers) varies or modifies any rights or obligations of the parties to the Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>

<p class="card-text">
6.6 Contacting DubaiKoin. Customer may contact DubaiKoin Ireland Limited and/or DubaiKoin LLC in connection with the Standard Contractual Clauses at legal-notices@DubaiKoin.com or through such other means as may be provided by DubaiKoin from time to time, including for the purposes of:<br>

(a) Clause II(e) of the Standard Contractual Clauses, to the extent DubaiKoin LLC acts as data importer and Customer acts as data exporter under the Standard Contractual Clauses; and<br>

(b) requesting an Audit under Section 6.8(a) below.<br></p>

<p class="card-text">
6.7 Responding to Data Subject Enquiries. For the purpose of Clause I(d) of the Standard Contractual Clauses, the applicable data importer will be responsible for responding to enquiries from data subjects and the authority concerning the processing of applicable Controller Personal Data by the data importer.</p>

<p class="card-text">
6.8 Reviews, Audits and Certifications of Compliance.<br>

(a) If the Standard Contractual Clauses apply under this Section 6 (Standard Contractual Clauses), the applicable data importer will allow the applicable data exporter or a third-party inspection agent or auditor appointed by the data exporter to request reasonable certification or conduct a reasonable review or audit as described in Clause II(g) of the Standard Contractual Clauses (“Audit”), in accordance with this Section 6.8 (Reviews, Audits and Certifications of Compliance).<br>

(b) Following receipt by the data importer of a request for an Audit, the data importer and the data exporter will discuss and agree in advance on the scope and rules of the Audit, including reasonable: start date, scope and duration, use of security certifications, cost allocation and reimbursement schedule, and security and confidentiality controls. The Audit will be conducted by mutually-agreed Audit members with a strict need-to-know and who have no conflicts-of-interest. The Audit will not require any party to disclose trade secrets, internal financial information, customer data, data protected from disclosure by applicable law (including the GDPR), or out-of-scope information<br></p>


<p class="card-text">
6.9 Third-Party Controllers. To the extent DubaiKoin LLC acts as data importer and Customer acts as data exporter under the Standard Contractual Clauses under Section 6.4 (Transfers of UK Controller Personal Data to DubaiKoin), DubaiKoin notifies Customer for the purpose of Clause II(i) that UK Controller Personal Data may be transferred to the third-party data controllers where requested by Customer, including through its use of or integration with the Controller Services.</p>


<p class="card-text">
<b>7. Liability</b><br></p>

<p class="card-text">7.1 Liability Cap. If the Agreement is governed by the laws of:<br>

(a) a state of the United States of America, then, regardless of anything else in the Agreement, the total liability of either party towards the other party under or in connection with these Controller Terms will be limited to the maximum monetary or payment-based amount at which that party’s liability is capped under the Agreement (and therefore any exclusion of indemnification claims from the Agreement’s limitation of liability will not apply to indemnification claims under the Agreement relating to the Data Protection Legislation); or<br>

(b) a jurisdiction that is not a state of the United States of America, then the liability of the parties under or in connection with these Controller Terms will be subject to the exclusions and limitations of liability in the Agreement.<br></p>

<p class="card-text">
7.2 Liability if the Standard Contractual Clauses Apply. If the Standard Contractual Clauses apply under Section 6 (Standard Contractual Clauses), then the total combined liability of each party and its Affiliates towards the other party and its Affiliates under or in connection with the Agreement and the Standard Contractual Clauses combined will be subject to Section 7.1 (Liability Cap). Clause III(a) of the Standard Contractual Clauses will not affect the previous sentence.</p>

<p class="card-text">
<b>8. Third-Party Beneficiaries</b><br>
If a party’s Affiliate is a party to the Standard Contractual Clauses that apply under Section 6 (Standard Contractual Clauses), then that Affiliate will be a third-party beneficiary of Sections 4.3 (End Controllers), 6 (Standard Contractual Clauses), and 7.2 (Liability if the Standard Contractual Clauses Apply). To the extent this Section 8 (Third-Party Beneficiaries) conflicts or is inconsistent with any other clause in the Agreement, this Section 8 (Third-Party Beneficiaries) will apply.</p>

<p class="card-text">
<b>9. Priority</b><br></p>
<p class="card-text">
9.1 Effect of these Controller Terms. If there is any conflict or inconsistency between the Standard Contractual Clauses, the Additional Terms for Non-European Data Protection Legislation, and these Controller Terms and/or the remainder of the Agreement then, subject to Sections 4.2 (Restrictions on Processing) and 9.2 (Processor Terms), the following order of precedence will apply:<br>

(a) the Standard Contractual Clauses;<br>

(b) the Additional Terms for Non-European Data Protection Legislation;<br>

(c) the remainder of these Controller Terms; and<br>

(d) the remainder of the Agreement.<br></p>

<p class="card-text">If this Agreement (including any Addendum) is translated into any other language, and the translated text conflicts or is inconsistent with the English text, the English text will govern.</p>

<p class="card-text">Subject to the amendments in these Controller Terms, the Agreement remains in full force and effect.</p>

<p class="card-text">9.2 Processor Terms. These Controller Terms will not affect any separate terms between DubaiKoin and Customer reflecting a controller-processor relationship for a service other than the Controller Services.</p>

<p class="card-text">
